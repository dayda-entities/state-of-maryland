<b>Summary</b>
The cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths among Maryland residents within a single Maryland jurisdiction.

<b>Description</b>
The MD COVID-19 - Confirmed Deaths by County data layer is a collection of the statewide confirmed COVID-19 related deaths that have been reported each day by the Vital Statistics Administration that have occurred in each Maryland jurisdiction. A death is classified as confirmed if the person had a laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 test result. Some data on deaths may be unavailable due to the time lag between the death, typically reported by a hospital or other facility, and the submission of the complete death certificate. This data layer does not include probable deaths. Probable deaths are available from the MD COVID-19 - Probable Deaths by County data layer.

<b>Terms of Use</b>
The Spatial Data, and the information therein, (collectively the "Data") is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory. The user assumes the entire risk as to quality and performance of the Data. No guarantee of accuracy is granted, nor is any responsibility for reliance thereon assumed. In no event shall the State of Maryland be liable for direct, indirect, incidental, consequential or special damages of any kind. The State of Maryland does not accept liability for any damages or misrepresentation caused by inaccuracies in the Data or as a result to changes to the Data, nor is there responsibility assumed to maintain the Data in any manner or form. The Data can be freely distributed as long as the metadata entry is not modified or deleted. Any data derived from the Data must acknowledge the State of Maryland in the metadata.
