To ensure that the Bay cleanup stays on track, a series of 2-year commitments called milestones have been established. The Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) has developed a list of BMPs (Best Management Practices) that would result in nutrient and sediment reductions to assist Maryland in meeting its milestone goals. This data set contains the descriptions of the BMPs.
