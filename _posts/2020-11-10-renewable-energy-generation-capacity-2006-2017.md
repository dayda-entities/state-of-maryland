This data set estimates the installed capacity for renewable energy generation in Maryland, in megawatts (MW).  Reported data comes from energy generators in Maryland registered to generate renewable energy credits (RECs) through the PJM Environmental Information Services (EIS) Generation Attributes Tracking System (GATS) (available at https://gats.pjm-eis.com/gats2/PublicReports/RenewableGeneratorsRegisteredinGATS).  As renewable energy generators are not required to register in GATS, there may be some renewable energy generation capacity installed in Maryland but not generating RECs that is not captured in this estimate.
