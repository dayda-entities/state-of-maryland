Early Prenatal Care - This indicator shows the percentage of pregnant women who receive prenatal care beginning in the first trimester. Inadequate prenatal care services have been linked to higher rates of infant mortality, low birth weight and pre-term deliveries. While Maryland as a whole ranks better than the National average and the Healthy People 2020 Target, disparities still exist. Due to the change in methodology for collecting information on the Maryland birth certificate, data collected in 2010 and after are not comparable to data collected in earlier years.
