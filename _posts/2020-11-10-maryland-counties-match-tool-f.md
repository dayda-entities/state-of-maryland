Data standardization is an important part of effective management. However, sometimes people have data that doesn't match. This dataset includes different ways that counties might get written by different people. It can be used as a lookup table when you need County to be your unique identifier. For example, it allows you to match St. Mary's, St Marys, and Saint Mary's so that you can use it with disparate data from other data sets.
