This dataset shows all data which Maryland Correctional Enterprises reported from May 2007 through July 2015. After which time the Performance Improvement Office asked the Dept of Public Safety and Corrections (DPSCS) to stop reporting it because there was plenty of historical data and marginal utility in continuing to report in on the Portal unless they have a need to. DPSCS will start reporting on it again if there is demand for updated data.
