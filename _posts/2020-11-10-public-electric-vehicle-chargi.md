It takes a lot of fuel to move Marylanders from point “A” to point “B.” The Maryland Energy Administration (MEA) offers incentives to reduce the amount of energy residents expend on travel. This table includes information about electric vehicle charging stations and alternative refueling stations that received funding by MEA as well as those that did not. Data on non-MEA funding projects in Maryland is from the U.S. Department of Energy: http://1.usa.gov/13VN2Vi.
