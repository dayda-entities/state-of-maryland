<b>Description</b>
The MD COVID-19 - Total Cases in Congregate Facility Settings data layer is a total of positive COVID-19 test results have been reported to MDH in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, group homes of 10 or more and state and local facilities for the reporting period.

Facilities are removed from the list when health officials determine 14 days have passed with no new cases and no tests pending. The list provides a point-in-time picture of COVID-19 case activity among these facilities. Numbers reported for each facility listed reflect totals ever reported for cases. Data are updated once weekly.
