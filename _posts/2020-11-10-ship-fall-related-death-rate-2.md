Fall-Related Death Rate - This indicator shows the rate of fall-related deaths per 100,000 population. Falls are a major cause of preventable death among the elderly and have increased across age groups in the past decade. Causes of fall-related deaths differ between the elderly and young and middle-aged populations, and require different prevention strategies. In 2009, falls accounted for 30% of accidental deaths.
