The Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) manages over 446,000 acres of public lands and protected open space in the state. The DNR Lands data  consists of mapped information that represent those lands that are owned by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. NOTE: Adjacent land may also be represented for topological completeness (inholdings) or because of their potential for natural resource protection (owned by federal, other state agency or local govenment) - see "ownedby" attribute for details. These files were created for the planning purposes of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. However, not all DNR owned lands have been surveyed and mapped at this time. Therefore, data should not be used as a definitive source of land ownership.
