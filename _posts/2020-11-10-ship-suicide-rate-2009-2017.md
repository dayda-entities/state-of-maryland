Suicide Rate - This indicator shows the suicide rate per 100,000 population. Suicide is a serious public health problem that can have lasting effects on individuals, families, and communities. Mental disorders and/or substance abuse have been found in the great majority of people who have died by suicide. In Maryland, approximately 500 lives are lost each year to this preventable cause of death.
