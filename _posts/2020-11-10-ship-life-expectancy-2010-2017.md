Life Expectancy - This indicator shows life expectancy from birth, in years. Life expectancy is a summary measure used to describe overall health. Life expectancy at birth is the average number of years a newborn is expected to live given current conditions. The life expectancy in the US is the highest in recorded history thanks to public health interventions such as improvements in sanitation and food safety, development and use of vaccines, and health promotion efforts.
