The Maryland Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), is a is a statewide telephone survey that tracks prevalence and trends over time for many health variables.  Survey data is weighted to the Maryland population.  BRFSS is available through a public, online database: http://www.marylandbrfss.org.  BRFSS data methodology changed in 2011; therefore, 2011 and after is not comparable to 2010 data and before.
