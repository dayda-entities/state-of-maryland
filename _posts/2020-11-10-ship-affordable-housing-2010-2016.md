Affordable Housing - This indicator shows the percentage of housing units sold that are affordable on the median teacherâ€™s salary. Affordable housing can improve health by providing greater stability and reducing stress. Having affordable housing can allow family resources to be used for other needs like healthy food and healthcare.
