PLEASE READ THIS DATASET DESCRIPTION IN FULL BEFORE EXPORTING ANY DATA. 

The data compiled in this dataset was provided by each County Board of Education. The data provides records of vendors that receive payments of $25,000 or more during a fiscal year from the County Board of Education. Chapter 541 of the Acts of 2019 requires each county school board must annually report (1) the name of a payee receiving a payment; (2) the location of a payee by postal zip code; (3) the amount of a payment; (4) for the Baltimore County Board of Education, the purpose for the payment and whether the payee is a minority business enterprise; and (5) for the Prince George’s County Board of Education, the budget data prepared under § 5-101 of the Education Article.

The bill defines a “payee” as any party who receives an aggregate payment
of $25,000 in a fiscal year from a school board. A “payee” does not include (1) a public
school employee with respect to the employee’s compensation; (2) a public school retiree with respect to the retiree’s retirement allowance; or (3) in Baltimore County, a third-party payee that accepts specified employee payroll-related payments.

All questions in regards to this data should be directed to the Maryland Department of Budget and Management or the individual county board of education(s).
