<b>Summary</b>
The cumulative number of probable COVID-19-related deaths among Maryland residents within a single Maryland jurisdiction.

<b>Description</b>
The MD COVID-19 - Probable Deaths by County data layer is a collection of the statewide probable COVID-19 related deaths that have been reported each day by the Vital Statistics Administration that have occured in each Maryland jurisdiction. A death is classified as probable if the person's death certificate notes COVID-19 to be a probable, suspect or presumed cause or condition. Probable deaths are not yet been confirmed by a laboratory test. Some data on deaths may be unavailable due to the time lag between the death, typically reported by a hospital or other facility, and the submission of the complete death certificate. This data layer does not include confirmed deaths. Confirmed deaths are available from the MD COVID-19 - Confirmed Deaths by County data layer.
