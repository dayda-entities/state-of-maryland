Maryland Mortgage Program (MMP), a program offered by the Community Development Administration (CDA), a part of the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) provides home loans and down payment assistance to Maryland families, encouraging homeownership and community growth. In partnership with commercial lenders, MMP offers competitive loans with the added benefit of down payment and closing cost assistance in the form of zero percent deferred loans that can be used in conjunction with funding from other sources (e. g. partnership program organizations).
