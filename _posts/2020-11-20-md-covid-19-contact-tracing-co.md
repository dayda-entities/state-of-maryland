<b>Summary</b>
The cumulative total of confirmed COVID-19 case contacts that have been entered into covidLINK and have been reached for contact tracing interviews as of the date of report.

<b>Description</b>
The MD COVID-19 - Contact Tracing Contacts Reached and Interviewed data layer reflects the cumulative total of confirmed COVID-19 case contacts that have been entered into covidLINK and have been reached for contact tracing interviews as of the date of report. Individuals that responded to outreach attempts and were veriﬁed as the intended call recipient are considered successfully reached. Not responding to calls is the primary reason contacts are not successfully reached. For contacts reached, reasons for not completing an interview include scheduling conﬂict, hospitalization/incapacitation, and refusal to participate. Data are updated weekly on Wednesday during the 10 a.m. hour (data is reported through the previous Saturday).
