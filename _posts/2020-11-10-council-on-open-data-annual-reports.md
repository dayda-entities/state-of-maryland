Maryland's Open Data Program provides transparency so that businesses, residents, visitors, and civil servants can use state data to aid in decision making. The transparency of data helps improve accountability, as data owners share the responsibility for ensuring that data is accurate, up-to-date and available to the public. Each January, the Council on Open Data makes it's Annual Open Data Report available to the public. Please explore the annual reports below to see how Maryland continues to support Open Data.
