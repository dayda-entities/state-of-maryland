Adults Who Currently Smoke - This indicator shows the percentage of adults who currently smoke. 7,500 adults in Maryland die each year due to tobacco-related causes, and 150,000 more suffer from tobacco-related diseases such as COPD, emphysema or cancers. Non-smokers – especially young children (and even pets) – are also affected by tobacco through exposure to the toxins found in secondhand smoke.
