<b>Description</b>
The MD COVID-19 - Confirmed Deaths by Age Distribution data layer is a collection of the statewide confirmed COVID-19 related deaths that have been reported each day by the Vital Statistics Administration by designated age ranges. A death is classified as confirmed if the person had a laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 test result. Some data on deaths may be unavailable due to the time lag between the death, typically reported by a hospital or other facility, and the submission of the complete death certificate. Probable deaths are available from the MD COVID-19 - Probable Deaths by Age Distribution data layer.
