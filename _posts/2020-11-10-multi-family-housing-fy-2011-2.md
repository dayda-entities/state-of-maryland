The Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development offers multifamily finance programs for the construction and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing units for low to moderate income families, senior citizens and individuals with disabilities.

Our multifamily bond programs issues tax-exempt and taxable revenue mortgage bonds to finance the acquisition, preservation and creation of affordable multifamily rental housing units in priority funding areas.

By advocating for increased production of rental housing units, we help create much-needed jobs and leverage opportunities to live, work and prosper for hardworking Maryland families, senior citizens, and individuals with disabilities throughout the state.​
