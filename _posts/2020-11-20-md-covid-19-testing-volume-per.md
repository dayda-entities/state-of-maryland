<b>Summary</b>
The 7-day average percent positive rate for COVID-19 tests adminstered among Marylanders under 35 years of age and over 35 years of age.

<b>Description</b>
Testing volume data represent the static daily total of PCR COVID-19 tests electronically reported for Maryland residents; this count does not include test results submitted by labs and other clinical facilities through non-electronic means. The 7-day percent postive rate is a rolling average of each dayâ€™s positivity percentage. The percentage is calculated using the total number of tests electronically reported to MDH (by date of report) and the number of positive tests electronically reported to MDH (by date of report). Electronic lab reports from NEDDSS.
