Hospitalization Rate Related To Alzheimer's Or Other Dementias - This indicator shows the rate of hospitalizations related to Alzheimer's or other dementias (per 100,000 population). In the US, an estimated 5.4 million people are living with Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Reducing the proportion of hospitalizations related to Alzheimer's and other dementias can decrease burdens on individuals, families, and the health care system in 2014.
