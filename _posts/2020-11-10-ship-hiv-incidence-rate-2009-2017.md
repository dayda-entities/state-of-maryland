HIV Incidence Rate  - This indicator shows the rate of adult/adolescent cases (age 13+) diagnosed with HIV (per 100,000 population). HIV is a significant and preventable public health problem. An estimated 16% of people with HIV in Maryland are undiagnosed. We have the knowledge and tools needed to slow the spread of HIV infection and improve the health of people living with HIV.
