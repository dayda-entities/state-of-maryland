Adolescents Who Have Obesity - "This indicator shows the percentage of adolescent public high school students who are obese. 

In the last 20 years, the percentage of overweight/obese children has more than doubled and, for adolescents, it has tripled. Overweight/obese children are at increased risk of developing life-threatening chronic diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes."
