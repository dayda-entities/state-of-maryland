On February 14, 2013 members of the Maryland HOPE Counseling Network were awarded $11.8 million in grant awards, the highest level of funding for foreclosure prevention counseling in state history. The period covered by these awards is fiscal years 2013-2015. The Network is a group of 39 statewide nonprofit agencies that provide foreclosure prevention assistance. The Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) provides financial support and training to these agencies. These counselors are the critical link in assisting individuals facing foreclosures, acting as a resource to negotiate reasonable terms with mortgage servicers, and advising citizens on the best actions to take to save their homes. The funds, made available through the Office of Attorney General Douglas Gansler and the Maryland Housing Counseling Fund, are part of Marylandâ€™s award from the National Mortgage Loan Servicing Practices Settlement and are being administered by DHCD.
