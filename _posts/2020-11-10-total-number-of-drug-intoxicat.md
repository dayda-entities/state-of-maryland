These data show total annual Maryland drug intoxication deaths from 2007 to 2016, broken down by substance. Since an intoxication death may involve more than one substance, counts of deaths related to specific substances do not sum to the total number of deaths. Benzodiazepine deaths include deaths caused by benzodiazepines and related drugs with similar sedative effects.
