Reported sewer overflows from January 2005 through December 22, 2016.  Although MDE requires that all public sewer system owners or operators report overflows to us, there may be incidents that were not reported. Note that overflow amounts provided by the person reporting the overflow may be estimated using best professional judgment or they may be actual readings from flow measurement devices when available.  

Penalty information started during 2013.
