This data set describes the amount of energy generated annually by renewable sources in Maryland in megawatt hours (MWh).  In addition, there is a column which describes the percent of all energy generated in Maryland coming from renewable sources each year.  Renewable energy generation data comes from PJM's Generation Attribute Tracking System (PJM GATS).  Total generation comes from the U.S. Energy Information Administration's State Level Generation report, released in October 2016 with revisions in November 2016 (available at https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data.php#generation).
