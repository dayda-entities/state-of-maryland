This dataset represents the CHANGE in the number of jobs per industry category and sub-category from the previous month, not the raw counts of actual jobs. The data behind these monthly change values is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Current Employment Statistics (CES) program. CES data represents businesses and government agencies, providing detailed industry data on employment on nonfarm payrolls.
