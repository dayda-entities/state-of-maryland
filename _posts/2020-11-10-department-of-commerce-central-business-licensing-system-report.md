The Department of Commerce reports these aggregate performance metrics for its Central Business Licensing System (CBL) to the Governor's Office of Performance Improvement (GOPI) each month. The Department of Information Technology (DoIT) formats and uploads the data to data.maryland.gov, and generates the descriptive analytics included here.

Legend for asterisks in column names:
*This represents business registrations from CBL and does not include tax accounts
**Comptroller tax account filings added
***Prior to June, 2014 this number included both SDAT and Comptroller numbers of businesses incorporated.  As of June, the number only includes SDAT numbers.
****Adoption rate-percentage calculation = CBL registrations divided by SDAT registrations
