Accessible Housing For Seniors is a sub-set of the Maryland Rehabilitation Loan Program. Numbers are tracked individually, when the rehabilitation work involves strictly accessibility features. Often times accessiblity improvements/rehabilitation is done as part of a larger project and the funding does not reflect in these numbers. For more information please visit www.mdhousing.org
