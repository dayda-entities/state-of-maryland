The Indoor Plumbing Program is a sub-set of the Maryland Rehabilitation Loan Program. Numbers are tracked individually, when the rehabilitation	work involves strictly plumbing, sewer and water related improvements. Often times IPP improvements/rehabilitation is done as part of a larger project and the funding does not reflect in these numbers.
