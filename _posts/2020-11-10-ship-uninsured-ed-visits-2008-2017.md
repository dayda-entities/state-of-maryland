Uninsured ED Visits - This indicator shows the percentage of persons without health (medical) insurance who seek care through the Emergency Department. People without health insurance are more likely to be in poor health than the insured. Lack of health insurance can result in increased visits to the emergency department and decreased routine care visits with a primary care provider.
