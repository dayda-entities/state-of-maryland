High School Graduation Rate - This indicator shows the percentage of students who graduate high school in four years. Completion of high school is one of the strongest predictors of health in later life. People who graduate from high school are more likely to have better health outcomes, regularly visit doctors, and live longer than those without high school diplomas.
