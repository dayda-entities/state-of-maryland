Infant Death Rate - This indicator shows the infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births. Infant mortality has long been considered the most sensitive indicator of the overall health of a population. While there have been several decades of improvement in infant mortality, Marylandâ€™s rate remains higher than the national average.
