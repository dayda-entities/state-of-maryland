Food Supplement Program (FSP) active cases are the number of total cases that are active at the end of the FSP benefit receiving month and for the following month. These cases are active because they are compliant with all FSP eligibility requirements.

Expedited Food Supplement Program approved cases are FSP cases that meet the expedited requirements and FSP eligibility requirements. 

Note: If expedited FSP cases remain active at the end of the application month, they will be included in the overall active FSP cases
