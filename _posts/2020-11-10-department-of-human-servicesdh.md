CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION

The performance measures are used to evaluate each State's performance and measure results in the Child Support Enforcement program. These measures emphasize paternity establishment, support order establishment, collection of current support, collection of arrearages, and cost effectiveness. The performance measures, except cost effectiveness which can only be measured annually, are calculated from data which is reported on federal form OCSE 157.  

CASES WITH SUPPORT ORDERS
This metric measures the proportion of IV-D cases with support orders established.

Equation:
Number of IV-D Cases with Support Orders divided by Total Number of IV-D Cases

IV-D Paternity Establishment Percentage:
This metric measures the proportion of children in the IV-D caseload as of the end of the preceding FFY who were born out of wedlock is the total number of children in the IV-D caseload in the federal fiscal year born out of wedlock with paternity established or acknowledged divided by the total number of children in the IV-D caseload as of the end of the preceding FFY who were born out of wedlock.  .

Equation:
Total # of Children in IV-D Caseload in the Federal Fiscal Year or, as of the end of the Fiscal Year who were born out of wedlock with Paternity Established or Acknowledged divided by Total # of Children in IV-D Caseload as of the end of the preceding Federal Fiscal Year who were Born Out of Wedlock

COLLECTIONS ON CURRENT SUPPORT
This measure focuses on the proportion of current support due that is collected on IV-D cases. 

Equation:
Total Dollars Collected for Current Support in IV-D Cases during the Federal Fiscal Year divided by Total Dollars Owed for Current Support in IV-D Cases during the Federal Fiscal Year

COLLECTIONS ON ARREARS
The measure assesses efforts to collect money from those cases with an arrearage due. 
The measure specifically counts paying cases, and not total arrears dollars collected.

Equation:
Total number of IV-D cases paying toward arrears during the Federal Fiscal Year divided by Total number of IV-D cases with arrears due
