To substantially reduce energy costs and consumption by State government, an energy/electricity competition was established in 2011 between the 16 largest energy-using agencies. Each agency's consumption of electricity (kWh) and total energy (MMBTU) from significant facilities is monitored in relation to a baseline year of FY 2008. Significant facilities are those that have been occupied by the State since 2008 and are air-conditioned.
				
An overall goal  is set for State agencies to reduce energy/electricity consumption by 15% by 2015 to Lead By Example. 

The Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 runs from July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2013. The Fiscal Year 2014 runs from July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014. The Fiscal Year 2015 runs from July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014.
