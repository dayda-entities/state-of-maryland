Children Receiving Blood Lead Screening - This indicator reflects the percentage of children (aged 12-35 months) enrolled in Medicaid (90+ days) screened for lead in their blood. Each pediatric Medicaid enrollee should be screened for blood lead during their 12 and 24-month well child visit. Common sources of pediatric lead exposure include dust and paint chips from chipping or peeling lead paint, as well as lead contaminated: soil, toys, water, cosmetics, and folk medicines.
