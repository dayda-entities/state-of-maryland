Children with Elevated Blood Lead Levels - "Lead is a toxic metal that has no safe level. Children are especially sensitive to lead exposure. The legal definition of an elevated blood lead level in Maryland is 10 micrograms/deciliter (mcg/dL), but the current CDC and Maryland guidelines for health care providers urge follow up for any child with a level of 5 mcg/dL or higher.  Children most often are exposed to lead if they swallow dust containing lead paint, usually when there is peeling, flaking, or chipping lead paint or from home renovation. Maryland health care providers are now supposed to test all children born on or after January 1, 2015 at their 12 and 24 month well child visits.
