The Special Loans Program rehabilitates homes of moderate income Maryland homeowners across the state in cooperation with the Local Government agencies. Types of rehabilitation include accessibility modifications for senior and disabled occupants, bringing electrical and/or plumbing systems to state and local codes, making roof and structural repairs, and in exceptional cases replacing an uninhabitable dwelling with a modest living structure.
