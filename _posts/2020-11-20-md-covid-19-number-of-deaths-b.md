<b>Summary</b>
Deaths at Maryland facilities where at least one confirmed case of COVID-19 is present for the reporting period.

<b>Description</b>
The MD COVID-19 - Number of Deaths by Affected Congregate Facility data layer is a collection of the number of deaths in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, group homes of 10 or more and state and local facilities where at least one positive COVID-19 test result has been reported for the reporting period. Data are reported to MDH by local health departments, the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services and the Department of Juvenile Services. To appear on the list, facilities report at least one confirmed case of COVID-19 over the prior 14 days. Facilities are removed from the list when health officials determine 14 days have passed with no new cases and no tests pending. The list provides a point-in-time picture of COVID-19 case activity among these facilities. Numbers reported for each facility listed reflect totals ever reported for deaths. Data are updated once weekly.
