Annual Season Influenza Vaccinations - This indicator shows the percentage of adults who are vaccinated annually against seasonal influenza. For many people, the seasonal flu is a mild illness, but for some it can lead to pneumonia, hospitalization, or death. Vaccination of persons in high-risk populations is especially important to reduce their risk of severe illness or death.
