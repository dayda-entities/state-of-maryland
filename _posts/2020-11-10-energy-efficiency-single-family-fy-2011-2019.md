The Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development offers programs that provide homeowners of all income levels with the resources to improve their home’s energy efficiency. Our programs can help with insulation, hot water system improvements, furnace repair or replacement, renewable energy systems, and other health and safety enhancements. The department also provides energy efficiency programs specifically for affordable, multifamily rental properties, as well as outreach and training to contractor partners who wish to participate in our programs for residential and small commercial projects. ​​​​
