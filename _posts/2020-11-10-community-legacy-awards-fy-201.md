The Community Legacy program provides local governments and community development organizations with funding for essential projects aimed at strengthening communities through activities such as business retention and attraction, encouraging homeownership and commercial revitalization.​

​As a result of the Sustainable Communities Act of 2010​. Community Legacy Areas are now known as Sustainable Communities. Funding, in the form of grants and loans, is available for projects located in these Sustainable Communities, formerly known as Community Legacy Areas, and is meant to compliment and supplement other State funding programs.​
