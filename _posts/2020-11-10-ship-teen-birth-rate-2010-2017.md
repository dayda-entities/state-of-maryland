Teen Birth Rate - This indicator shows the rate of births to teens ages 15-19 years (per 1,000 population). Teen pregnancy is linked to a host of social problems such as poverty, lack of overall child well-being, out-of-wedlock births, lack of responsible fatherhood, health issues, school failure, child abuse and neglect and at-risk behaviors.
