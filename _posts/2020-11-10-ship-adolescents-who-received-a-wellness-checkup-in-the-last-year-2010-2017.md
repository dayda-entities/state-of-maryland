Adolescents Who Received A Wellness Checkup In The Last Year - This indicator reflects the percentage of adolescents (ages 13-20 years old) enrolled in Medicaid (320+ days) who received at least one well child visit during the past year. Adolescents are at heightened risk for a variety of poor health outcomes associated with: violence (homicide/suicide/intimate partner); injuries (motor vehicle/occupational/sports related); substance use and abuse; sexually transmitted infections, including HIV; unplanned pregnancies and homelessness. Well child visits provide the opportunity for health care providers to engage in primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of poor health outcomes associated with these factors resulting in prevention, early detection, and treatment for issues that can otherwise have a life-long devastating impact on individuals.
