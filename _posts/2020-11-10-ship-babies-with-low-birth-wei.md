Babies with Low Birth Weight - This indicator shows the percentage of live births that are a low birth weight (2500 grams or less). Babies born with a low birth weight are at increased risk for serious health consequences including disabilities and death. Low birth weight babies weigh less than 2,500 grams (5.5 pounds). Marylandâ€™s low birth weight percentage is higher than the national average.
