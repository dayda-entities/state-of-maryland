Children Receiving Dental Care In The Last Year - This indicator reflects the percentage of children (aged 0-20 years) enrolled in Medicaid (320+ days) who received at least one dental visit during the past year. Poor oral health can lead to problems with nutrition, growth, school and workplace readiness, and speech. Adoption and use of recommended oral hygiene measures are critical to maintaining overall health.
